Search Bar Project

Fetched two API's from the url below
https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api/json/v1/1/search.php?s
https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api/json/v1/1/search.php?s=margarita


The objective was to map through each of the arrays and hide the values that do not match in the input search bar. The search bar is set up to hide values that do not match a name or an item in the ingredient list. 

On the index.html, a card template was used to map the fetched API information to it. 

Images for each drink are fetched from the API URL as well.
